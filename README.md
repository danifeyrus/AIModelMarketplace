# AI Model Marketplace dApp

This decentralized application (dApp) allows users to list, purchase, and rate AI models. The marketplace is built using Ethereum smart contracts, allowing for secure and decentralized transactions between users and model creators.

## Features

- **List Models**: Users can list new AI models on the marketplace by providing a name, description, and price.
- **Purchase Models**: Users can buy listed models with Ether and support model creators.
- **Rate Models**: After purchasing a model, users can rate it, contributing to the model's overall rating score.
- **Withdraw Funds**: Model creators can withdraw earnings from the sales of their models.
